There are several other indices that we can use to supplement the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Some of these include the following:
- The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) measures changes in the selling prices of new houses in Canada.
- The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) measures changes in the selling prices of industrial products in Canada.
- The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) measures changes in the prices of raw materials used in the production of goods in Canada.
- The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at basic prices measure of the total value of goods and services produced in Canada.
- Exchange Rate USD  measures the Canadian dollar value against American currancy.
- The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX )  which is the largest stock exchange in Canada.

In what follows we compare the trends of these indices over the last 36 months.
